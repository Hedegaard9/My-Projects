My Projects from Studies and Spare Time
By Andreas Kjær Hedegaard

This document highlights a combination of projects developed in both R and Python.

Python for the Financial Economist
This project focuses on finding the optimal hedge by simulating risk and return distributions. It also determines the efficient frontier and constructs minimum variance portfolios. Furthermore, it explores covariance uncertainty in relation to optimal risk, providing insights into risk management strategies and portfolio optimization.

Sports Economics Assignment
This assignment delves into the economics of the Premier League, analyzing the financial inequality between clubs. It also predicts the league’s expected winner based solely on economic factors, utilizing various machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the project evaluates the potential future impact of banning betting sponsors on the league's economic landscape.

Data-Driven Decision Making
This project consists of a series of exercises from a machine learning course, implemented in RStudio. It evaluates and compares various machine learning models to analyze their performance and applicability.

Bachelor Thesis Code
The code for my bachelor thesis implements Enhanced Portfolio Optimization. Although not written with a focus on style, it effectively applies advanced shrinkage techniques to achieve optimal in-sample and out-of-sample portfolio performance. The thesis also compares different portfolio strategies, such as 1/N and risk parity. Additionally, it incorporates a no-shorting constraint, revealing some limitations in the model's robustness under certain conditions.

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to work across diverse fields, applying data-driven methodologies to solve complex problems and generate actionable insights.
